[Roadmap.sh Frontend Dev](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)

This website indicated the necessary knowledge that is required to become a successful Frontend Developer. The website uses a **roadmap** style layout to help indicating where to start learning, and which direction to progress.

## Comment from Ruby
> The roadmap layout presents the Frontend development process well in a sense it is very easy to follow and determine which technologies/knowledge areas a developer will need as well as the author's personal comments on each aspect that could be especially helpful for someone who has just begun learning. I myself found extremely informative and was able to determine which area I need to work on more.
